# EvolutionaryGames

A project designed for Computational Intelligence course. <br> <br>
In this project, a simple 2D minigame is implemented. <br>
The agent needs to learn to maneuver via neural network + evolution.


## Game Modes
Helicopter             |  Gravity          |  Thrust

## CI-EvolutionaryGames
In this project, I (Zahra Salarian) implemented an evolutionary algorithm that has the capability of learning 3 different modes of playing this game, and when it has learned them after several generations of playing, it becomes unbeatable and can play forever.
